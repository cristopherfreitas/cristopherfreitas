### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cristopher Freitas. As a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer, my primary responsibility is to lead the development and deployment of ML systems. I design and implement end-to-end ML pipelines, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation, and then deploy the models into production. I optimize and scale the ML systems to meet performance, reliability, and security requirements. As a member of the Voxy team, I collaborate with stakeholders from other departments, such as data analysts, product managers, and software engineers, to align the ML systems with business objectives and ensure that they are integrated smoothly into the overall software stack. I stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field of ML and contribute to the development of the team's ML strategy and best practices.
